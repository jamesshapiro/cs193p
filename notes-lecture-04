View:
=====
-subclass of UIView
-for drawing
-for handling touch events
-hierarchical
 + a view has at most one superview (var superview: UIView?)
 + but any number of subviews var (var subviews[UIView])
 + subviews later in the array are layered on top of those earlier
 + a view can clip subviews to its own bounds (default is not to)
 + example: in Calculator, we have stacks on stacks of buttons.
   The high-level stack containing everything is the superview
   of all of the other views.
 + the hierarchy is most often constructed in InterfaceBuilder
   in Xcode, graphically. Even custome views are usually added to
   the view hierarchy using Xcode.
